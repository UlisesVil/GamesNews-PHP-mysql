# GamesNews (PHP-MySQL).

This application uses PHP and MySQL. It is running on a host with all its functions, and it is fully responsive.

In this application, we can register and log in by saving the user's data in the database with an encrypted password.

In addition, the application distinguishes between a user or Administrator. If you log in as an administrator, we will have more options available in the menu that will allow us, Create, Edit and delete an entry (news) and Create a new category of games.

The user is allowed to enter and navigate the site without registration. The user can make comments only if he is registered and logged in. He will also be able to edit or delete his comments.

If the user does not log in, the comment box will remain inactive.

jQuery is present in the Sidebar menu control.

A feeling of dynamism has been added to the page, with particles JS library to animate the background. Particles react to the mouse pointer in certain parts of the page.
